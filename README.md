## Owen Lamb

I am a former Geographic Information Systems Specialist who loves to code. I used to look forward to the 5% of my day when I could write code, so I decided to make it a career. My colleagues describe me as highly focused, extremely goofy, and drop dead serious when it matters most. I am seeking a role as a junior developer at an organization that cares about clean-code, testing, team-work and building great software.

## Skills

#### Ruby, JavaScript, and TDD
- Learned the principles of TDD with Ruby and JavaScript at Makers Academy.
- Using Rspec my final project, [TeemApp](https://github.com/ojlamb/final_project), achieved 97% test coverage.
- Gained experience with Sinatra and web framework MVC configuration building a [Twitter Clone](https://github.com/ojlamb/chitter-challenge).
- Learned AngularJS with Protractor and Karma Testing and built a [ToDo List](https://github.com/ojlamb/todo_challenge).

#### Leadership and Team-work
- Successfully pitched an idea for Makers Academy final projects. One of five to be prototyped.
- Led twice daily stand-up meetings and executed agile development practices, pushing
  production code daily, and pair-programmed exclusively. View a Live Demo of [TeemApp](http://teemapp.herokuapp.com)
- Additionally, during my time at DCP Midstream I supported over 80 field personnel with
  GIS and Mapping tasks. I developed my communication, leadership, and team working
  skills while building new procedures and workflows which ultimately improved
  efficiency and safety.

#### Database Design
- Gained experience with database design through my work at DCP Midstream
  and Zayo Group, modeling natural gas pipelines and telecommunications infrastructure.
- Experience with multiple databases including Postgres, MySQL, and Oracle.
- Comfortable with writing SQL queries and using ORMs DataMapper and Active Record.


#### Web Mapping
- Background in Geo Sciences with 3 years experience working in GIS.
- Passion for maps, and spatial information. My final project was built using Ruby on Rails
  which we integrated with JavaScript and multiple APIs including MapBox, and Leaflet.
- View the mapping functionality of the application here: [TeemApp - MapView](http://teemapp.herokuapp.com/locations)
